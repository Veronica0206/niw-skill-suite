# Field Alignment Reference

**Last updated:** 2025
**Rule:** Technology labels (AI, ML, data science, blockchain, cloud) are METHODS.
Strip them. Evaluate the APPLICATION DOMAIN.

## The Core Test

> "AI applied to *what*?"
> "[Technology] used for *what purpose*, serving *whom*, at *what scale*?"

The answer to that question is the domain. That domain determines tier.

---

## Tier 1 — NSTC / White House Explicit Priority Areas

Full national importance standing. Strong foundation for NIW.

| Domain | Examples |
|---|---|
| Semiconductor / Microelectronics | Chip design, fab yield, supply chain |
| Cybersecurity / Critical Infrastructure | Threat detection, grid security, network defense |
| Biotechnology / Public Health | Disease surveillance, pandemic response, drug development |
| Clean Energy / Climate Technology | Grid optimization, carbon capture, renewable energy |
| Quantum Information Science | Quantum computing, quantum networking, cryptography |
| Advanced Manufacturing | Robotics, materials science, precision manufacturing |
| Space Technology | Launch systems, satellite infrastructure, space medicine |
| STEM Education / Workforce Pipeline | Science education, STEM access and equity |
| Foundational AI/CS Research* | New architectures, safety alignment, training methods |

*Foundational AI only if: top venue publications (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/Nature/Science)
AND cross-domain adoption evidence. "I do ML research" is not sufficient.

## Tier 2 — Recognized National Interest, Requires Stronger Evidence

Can support NIW but framing and evidence must be more rigorous.

| Domain | Key Framing Requirement |
|---|---|
| Financial security / fraud prevention | Must show systemic or national-scale impact, not just company KPIs |
| Transportation safety / Autonomous systems | Must connect to infrastructure or public safety at scale |
| Agriculture / Food security | Must connect to supply chain resilience or feeding populations |
| Supply chain resilience | Must connect to U.S. economic security or critical goods |
| Drug safety / Pharmacovigilance | Must connect to public health outcomes, not just company efficiency |
| Education technology | Must tie to workforce outcomes, equity, or STEM pipeline |
| Environmental monitoring / Disaster response | Must connect to public safety or infrastructure |

---

## Tier 3 — Difficult to Justify

High burden of proof. Field does not carry independent national importance.
Evidence and framing must be exceptional — and even then, risk is high.

| Domain | Why It's Difficult |
|---|---|
| Marketing / AdTech | Business optimization, not public benefit |
| Consumer personalization | Engagement ≠ national interest |
| Retail / E-commerce | No public benefit standing |
| Entertainment / Media | Unless specifically disinformation, accessibility, or IP protection |
| Social media engagement | Growth metrics are not national interest metrics |
| General BI / Analytics | Too broad; must identify specific Tier 1–2 application |
| HR / Talent optimization | Internal company function |

## Common Misclassifications

| User Claims | Actual Tier | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "AI research" (no domain) | None | AI alone is a method. No domain = no tier. |
| "AI for healthcare" | 1 | Public health is Tier 1 |
| "AI for drug discovery" | 1 | Biotechnology is Tier 1 |
| "AI for cybersecurity" | 1 | Cybersecurity is Tier 1 |
| "AI for climate modeling" | 1 | Clean energy/climate is Tier 1 |
| "AI for fraud detection (banking)" | 2 | Financial security — needs national scale evidence |
| "AI for personalized medicine" | 1 | Public health + precision medicine |
| "AI for marketing personalization" | 3 | Marketing is Tier 3 regardless of AI |
| "AI for recommendation systems" | 3 | Consumer engagement, not national interest |
| "ML for supply chain" | 2 | Supply chain resilience — if tied to critical goods |
| "NLP for content moderation" | 2 | Could be framed as disinformation/infrastructure protection |
| "Data science for finance" | 2–3 | Depends entirely on application: fraud=2, trading=3 |
| "Computer vision for retail" | 3 | Retail optimization is Tier 3 |
| "Computer vision for medical imaging" | 1 | Public health is Tier 1 |

## Edge Cases Requiring Judgment

**Disinformation / Content moderation:**
Could be Tier 1 (national security, election integrity) or Tier 3 (social media
engagement), depending on framing and scale. Must demonstrate genuine connection
to democratic infrastructure, not just platform health metrics.

**FinTech / Financial services:**
Fraud prevention and systemic risk → Tier 2 (strong framing needed)
Consumer lending optimization → Tier 3
Payment infrastructure security → Tier 2
Algorithmic trading → Tier 3

**Education technology:**
K-12 STEM pipeline, underserved communities, workforce development → Tier 2
Consumer tutoring apps, test prep → Tier 3

**Consumer health apps:**
Clinical-grade tools, FDA-regulated, population health → Tier 1–2
Wellness/fitness tracking, lifestyle → Tier 3
