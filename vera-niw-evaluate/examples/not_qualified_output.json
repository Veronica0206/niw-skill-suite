There are five blocking gaps, the most fundamental being field alignment and complete absence of credible evidence. Filing in this state would almost certainly result in denial and could complicate future immigration applications. The honest path forward: (1) transition to a role with clearer national importance (e.g., fraud/security, public health, infrastructure); (2) build a 3–5 year record with verifiable, externally evidenced contributions; (3) secure proper reference letters. Revisit in 2–3 years with a stronger profile."
