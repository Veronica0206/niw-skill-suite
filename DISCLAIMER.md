## Not Legal Advice

The NIW Skill Suite and all associated tools, documents, and outputs are provided for **informational and educational purposes only**. Nothing in this repository constitutes legal advice, immigration counsel, or a professional attorney-client relationship.

## No Guarantee of Outcome

Use of these tools does not guarantee approval of any immigration petition, visa application, or benefit request. Immigration outcomes depend on individual circumstances, USCIS adjudicator discretion, and applicable law — none of which these tools can predict or control.

## Consult a Qualified Attorney

If you are preparing an EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) petition or any other immigration filing, you should consult with a qualified immigration attorney licensed to practice in your jurisdiction. These tools are designed to supplement — not replace — professional legal counsel.

## Accuracy and Currency

While these tools are built on analysis of 5,000+ AAO decisions and the Dhanasar framework, immigration law and policy change frequently. The authors do not guarantee that the information encoded in these skills is current, complete, or accurate for any specific case.

## Limitation of Liability

The authors and contributors of this repository shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or adverse immigration outcomes arising from the use of these tools. Users assume all risk associated with their use.

## AI-Generated Content

Outputs from these skills are generated by AI language models. All AI-generated content should be reviewed by a qualified human — ideally an immigration attorney — before being used in any official filing.

## Privacy

These tools run locally in your Claude session. No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by this repository. However, users should be aware that their interactions with Claude are subject to Anthropic's privacy policy.
