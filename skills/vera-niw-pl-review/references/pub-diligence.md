# Publication Due Diligence — 5-Step Audit

## D-1: Venue Quality (Tier Assessment)

**TIER 1 — Strong weight:**
- Journals in Web of Science / Scopus with impact factor above 2.0 in the
  relevant field
- Nature, Science, PNAS and family journals
- Top field-specific venues: JAMA, NEJM (medicine); NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR,
  ACL, CVPR (AI/ML); top law reviews; NBER (economics)
- Journals with documented peer review, named editorial boards, and rejection
  rates below 30%

**TIER 2 — Acceptable with context:**
- Scopus Q2–Q3 journals, impact factor 1.0–2.0
- Mid-tier IEEE/ACM Transactions journals (e.g., IEEE Trans. Neural Networks,
  ACM Computing Surveys)
- Selective conferences with documented acceptance rates below 30%: AAAI,
  KDD, WWW, SIGKDD, ICCV

**TIER 3 — WEAK — flag explicitly:**
- Conferences with no verifiable acceptance rate or known rates above 50%
- Venues where publication follows registration fee payment without documented
  blind review
- MDPI journals: flag unless the specific journal has a verified impact factor
  above 2.0 — MDPI's article processing charge model and high acceptance rates
  disqualify most of their portfolio
- Generic IEEE-branded conferences (hundreds exist annually with minimal review
  rigor — "published at IEEE" is not sufficient; identify the specific
  conference and verify selectivity)
- Workshops, extended abstracts, or non-archival proceedings
- Preprints (arXiv, SSRN) with no subsequent peer-reviewed publication

**TIER 4 — DISQUALIFYING — raise as red flag:**
- Journals on Beall's List or known predatory journal databases
- Venues where the petitioner cannot confirm the review process
- "Conference proceedings" with no identifiable program committee

## D-2: Sustained Record and Research Trajectory

This step gates the rest of the publication analysis. Before evaluating venue
quality or citation counts, assess whether the petitioner has a credible,
organic research trajectory.

**Ideal profile:** Earlier foundational work (3–5+ years ago) → increasing
output and citation uptake → recent work building on the earlier foundation.
This arc demonstrates a genuine researcher, not someone who published
specifically to support an immigration petition.

**HIGH RISK — flag if:**
- All publications clustered in the past 1–2 years with no earlier work —
  strongly suggests petition-driven publication
- Only one publication year in the entire record, regardless of recency
- Earliest publication is within 18 months of petition filing — no way to
  demonstrate sustained momentum
- Publication topics shift dramatically between years with no coherent
  intellectual thread — suggests opportunistic publishing, not a research
  program

**MEDIUM RISK — flag if:**
- Record spans 2–3 years only, most output concentrated in the most recent year
- Earlier work exists but shows no citation uptake (published and ignored)
- Trajectory is flat (same output, same venue tier, same citation level year
  over year) rather than exponential

**PASSES:**
- Publications spanning 4+ years, with demonstrable growth in venue tier,
  citation uptake, or scope over time
- Earlier work cited by the petitioner's own later work AND by independent
  researchers — demonstrating an accumulating body of contribution
- Coherent intellectual thread connecting early and recent work

> **Note on industry petitioners**: A strong industry record and limited
> academia is evaluated differently — see D-5. But for petitioners whose
> Prong 2 case rests primarily on publications, a thin trajectory is a
> near-disqualifying weakness regardless of how impressive the most recent
> paper appears.

## D-3: Authorship Position

**Flag as weaknesses:**
- All or most publications list petitioner as middle or last author (last
  author can indicate PI/advisor role in academic contexts — verify; middle
  authorship without explanation is weak)
- No first-authored or corresponding-authored publications in Tier 1 or 2 venues
- First-authorship only on Tier 3 or 4 venues

**PASSES:**
- First or corresponding authorship on at least one Tier 1 or 2 venue
- Clear explanation of authorship role where position is ambiguous

## D-4: Citation Quality

Raw citation counts are nearly meaningless without the following decomposition.
Apply all filters:

**Age-adjusted rate:** Citations per year since publication is more informative
than total count. A 2024 paper with 25 citations in one year is notable. A 2019
paper with 25 citations across six years (≈4/year) is unremarkable in most
fields. Do not allow the petition to present a raw number without this
adjustment.

**Self-citation exclusion:** Remove all citations from the petitioner's own
subsequent papers. Self-citation inflates counts and is easily spotted. If the
petition does not distinguish self-citations from independent citations, treat
the total count as unverified.

**Citing venue quality:** Who is citing matters as much as how many. Citations
from Tier 3–4 venues carry minimal weight. A paper cited 30 times by workshop
papers and preprints is weaker than one cited 10 times by Tier 1 journals.

**Concentration risk:** If 80%+ of total citations come from a single paper,
the petitioner does not have a broadly influential body of work — they have one
paper that got traction. Flag explicitly. USCIS looks for a pattern of
influence, not a single data point.

**h-index context:** If an h-index is claimed, benchmark it against field norms
for the petitioner's career stage. An h-index of 4 is not impressive for a
mid-career academic; it may be acceptable 2–3 years post-PhD. Require field
context.

**Verifiability:** Citation counts must be traceable to Google Scholar, Web of
Science, or Scopus. Unverifiable counts are assertions, not evidence. Flag any
count not exhibit-supported with a screenshot or export.

**Double-counting flags:**
- Preprint citations that also count in the peer-reviewed version
- Citations that occurred before the peer-reviewed version published (citing
  the preprint only, not the published paper)

## D-5: Industry Record Exception

If the petitioner has a demonstrably strong industry record, the publication
bar may be partially offset. This exception applies ONLY if:

- Third-party verifiable evidence of industry impact (not self-reported): named
  products, documented deployments, press coverage, patents, or measurable
  outcomes cited by independent sources
- Industry contributions are at a leading or indispensable level, not routine
  professional output
- Employer letter specifically quantifies the petitioner's individual
  contribution (not team contribution)

If invoking this exception, explicitly state which publication weakness is
being offset and by what industry evidence. Do not apply broadly — it covers
gaps, it does not eliminate the publication requirement entirely.
