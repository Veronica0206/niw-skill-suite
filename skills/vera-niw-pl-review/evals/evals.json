This approach directly addresses a $42 billion annual loss gap identified in the Federal Reserve's 2023 Payments Security Report (Exhibit C-1), where existing rule-based systems miss 23% of coordinated fraud patterns. I have already published three peer-reviewed papers on TGADF (Exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3), two fintech companies have licensed the approach (Exhibit D-5), and I have presented the framework at the IEEE Financial Technology Security Symposium at the invitation of the program committee (Exhibit D-4).
