The combination of a PhD from a top program, above-threshold publication and citation record, and — crucially — real government adoption with public objective evidence is exactly what NIW reviewers want to see. The only gap is absence of reference letters, which is standard to address. Recommend proceeding to NIW_Endeavor with the three pillar previews above."
