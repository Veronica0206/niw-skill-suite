Biotechnology and public health are Tier 1 NSTC priorities. Field alignment is strong. However, field strength cannot compensate for weak evidence on the industry contribution claim.",
  "evaluator_notes": "This case is promising but not ready. The fundamental problem is that the most impressive claim — deploying a model in clinical trial design at Pfizer — has zero external evidence. USCIS reviewers are trained to be skeptical of unverified industry claims. If David can surface any public documentation of this work (a conference abstract, a ClinicalTrials.gov entry, a co-authored paper with a Pfizer principal), the case moves to LIKELY_QUALIFIED. Without it, filing now risks a Request for Evidence (RFE) or outright denial, which damages future attempts. Recommend addressing the blocking gap before proceeding."
