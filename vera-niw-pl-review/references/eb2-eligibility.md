# EB-2 Threshold Eligibility — Gate Check

*Referenced from SKILL.md Pattern 0. Read before any Dhanasar prong analysis.*

USCIS evaluates NIW merits only after confirming underlying EB-2 eligibility.
If this gate fails, the Dhanasar analysis is moot.

## Advanced Degree Route

**Flag as DEFICIENT if:**
- The intended occupation is not clearly a "profession" requiring at least a
  bachelor's degree as a standard entry requirement.
- Post-degree experience is not documented as directly related to the specialty.
- Experience letters do not explicitly use the phrase **"full-time"** — USCIS
  now rejects letters documenting years of work without expressly stating
  full-time status. Partial or ambiguous language triggers automatic failure.
- Required progressive experience is not documented as occurring **after**
  the bachelor's degree was earned.

> RFE language: "The petitioner must first establish statutory eligibility for
> EB-2... the update also explains that exceptional ability must relate to the
> same endeavor described in the NIW request."

## Exceptional Ability Route (6-criterion test)

**Flag as DEFICIENT if:**
- The six USCIS criteria for exceptional ability are not counted and mapped
  explicitly in the petition record.
- Exceptional ability is not tied to **the same endeavor** described in the
  NIW request — a mismatch between the EB-2 basis and the proposed endeavor
  is a standalone RFE trigger independent of the Dhanasar analysis.

**The six criteria (3 of 6 required):**
1. Official academic record showing degree related to the area of exceptional ability
2. Letters documenting 10+ years of full-time experience in the occupation
3. License to practice the profession (if applicable)
4. Commanding salary evidencing exceptional ability
5. Membership in professional associations requiring outstanding achievement
6. Recognition for achievements from peers, government entities, or professional/business organizations

## Common EB-2 Failure Modes

| Issue | Flag Level |
|---|---|
| Experience letter omits "full-time" phrase | HIGH — automatic failure risk |
| Exceptional ability claimed but EB-2 basis is advanced degree | Flag mismatch |
| Post-degree experience in a different specialty | MEDIUM — must document relatedness |
| Bachelor's + experience route: experience pre-dates degree | HIGH — USCIS requires post-degree |
| Exceptional ability criteria not individually counted | MEDIUM — adjudicators count them explicitly |
